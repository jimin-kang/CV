        <p class="headDescription">
          My name is Jimin Kang, and I am a student-athlete at Amherst College (c/o 2023)
          studying mathematics and computer science.
          Math and CS intrigue me because they are subjects where many concepts seem abstract initially,
          but with enough practice its applications for explaining phenomenon in everyday life become apparent.
          These subjects mix computational logic with creativity - given some intuitive facts, what
          conclusions can we reach? Studying math and CS has helped me improve my general problem solving skills - by
          understanding individual steps, you can end up solving much more complex puzzles
          than you may have anticipated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although my academic interests are mostly quantitative, I believe the most socially impactful work
          is done at the intersection of multiple disciplines. One of the main reasons I chose to attend Amherst
          is because its open liberal arts curriculum allows its students to take a variety of coursework
          in addition to major requirements - nights where I've had to write analyitical papers about
          philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and then complete linear algebra problem sets have
          expanded my mind in a manner many other students don't have the opportunity to experience.
          My well-rounded education has equipped me with the critical thinking skills necessary to take on any
          role that requires solving complex problems to drive social impact.

    <h4 class="skillHeading">Programming</h4>
    <p class="skillDescription">
      I have been programming since I started high school. Throughout high school I gained a lot of
      experience in game development by exploring topics such as GUIs, pathfinding algorithms, game AI and
      recursion to make games as entertaining and user friendly as possible. In addition to game development, I learned
      basic concepts of artificial intelligence & data science such as regression algorithms, neural networks, and image
      classification. My college computer science coursework has consisted of basic software engineering concepts such
      as OOP and has solidified my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

    <h4 class="skillHeading">Baseball</h4>
    <p class="skillDescription">
      I've played baseball since I was 5 years old - playing the game has helped me develop lifelong
      friendships and habits that have translated into all aspects of my life.
      Playing baseball competitively
      throughout high school and now college has shown me the power of teamwork, self-confidence, and
      work ethic in a manner that
      can't be learned through solely in an academic setting. Additionally, juggling a demanding athletic schedule with heavy
      academic workload has forced me to learn how to efficiently manage my time and maintain self-discipline.
